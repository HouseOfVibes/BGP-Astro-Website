## Psalm 100:4 (NKJV)
> "Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,  
> And into His courts with praise.  
> Be thankful to Him, and bless His name."

### Understanding the Context

Psalm 100 is one of the most joyful psalms in the Bible — a call for all the earth to worship the Lord with gladness. Written as a song of praise, it celebrates God's steadfast love and faithfulness. In ancient times, people would enter the temple courts singing, expressing gratitude for His goodness. The psalm reminds us that thanksgiving is not just a feeling — it’s a doorway into His presence.

### What This Means for Us

#### 1. **Gratitude is Our Entry Point**
Before we ask for anything, God invites us to come before Him with thanksgiving. A grateful heart changes how we approach Him — not as beggars, but as beloved children who recognize His goodness in every season.

#### 2. **Praise Prepares Our Hearts**
Praise shifts our focus from our problems to His promises. When we exalt His name, our perspective aligns with His power. Worship is more than music — it’s the posture of a heart that acknowledges God’s sovereignty.

#### 3. **Bless His Name Daily**
"Bless His name" means to speak well of Him — to testify of His goodness in our homes, workplaces, and communities. Gratitude becomes a testimony when others see peace and joy shining through us.

### Practical Application

This month, let’s be intentional about cultivating thanksgiving:

- **Keep a gratitude journal** — write down three things you’re thankful for each day.  
- **Begin your prayers with praise** — thank God before making requests.  
- **Speak life** — use your words to bless others and glorify God.  

### Reflection Questions

1. What are some things you can thank God for right now?  
2. How does praise help you face challenges with faith?  
3. Who can you bless with words of encouragement this week?  

### Prayer

*Father God, thank You for inviting us into Your presence with joy and thanksgiving. Teach us to enter Your gates with grateful hearts and to fill our days with praise. May our lives reflect Your goodness and bring glory to Your name. In Jesus’ name, amen.*
