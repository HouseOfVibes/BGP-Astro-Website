## ✅ Completed Security Enhancements

### 1. **NPM Package Updates**
- ✅ Cleaned and reinstalled all node modules
- ✅ Updated Astro from v5.14.6 to v5.15.2
- ✅ Reduced vulnerabilities from 4 to 3

**Remaining Issues:**
- 3 high severity vulnerabilities in `path-to-regexp` (build-time dependency only)
- These are in the Vercel adapter, not in production code
- **Impact:** Low risk - only affects build process, not the live website
- **Note:** Requires breaking changes to fix (`npm audit fix --force`)

### 2. **Security Headers Configuration**
Created `vercel.json` with comprehensive security headers:

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Restricts script sources to trusted domains only
- Allows Google Analytics and Font Awesome CDN
- Permits Google Calendar embeds
- Allows FormSubmit.co for contact forms

#### Additional Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Referrer-Policy:** Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy:** Restricts browser features (geolocation, microphone, camera)
- **X-XSS-Protection:** Enables browser XSS protection
