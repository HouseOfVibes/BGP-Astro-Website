## Component Props Interface

### ScriptureMonth.astro Props *(Updated - No Props Required)*
The component now auto-calculates the current month and year using JavaScript `Date()` object. The scripture content is hardcoded in the component and should be updated monthly by editing the component file directly.

**Current Scripture:**
- Month: Auto-calculated (October 2025)
- Verse: "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."
- Reference: II Timothy 1:7 (NKJV)

**To Update Monthly:**
Edit the component file at `src/components/home/ScriptureMonth.astro` and update the blockquote and cite elements.

---

## Styling Approach

### Utility-First with Tailwind
- Used Tailwind utility classes for most styling
- Custom CSS in component <style> tags only when necessary
- Responsive breakpoints:
  - Mobile: < 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 992px
  - Desktop: > 992px

### Custom Styles Used For:
- Background gradients with images (Hero)
- Complex hover effects
- Media-specific background images
- Clamp() typography for fluid scaling

---

## Responsive Design Patterns

### Hero Section
- Fluid typography using clamp()
- Mobile background image swap
- Full viewport height on all devices

### Service Info
- 3 columns on desktop
- 2 columns on tablet (if needed)
- 1 column stacked on mobile
- Centered cards with max-width

### Leadership
- Side-by-side layout on desktop
- Stacked layout on mobile
- Images scale proportionally

---

## SEO Implementation

### Homepage SEO Data
```javascript
const seoData = {
  title: "Believer's Gathering Place - A Place to Belong, Believe, and Become",
  description: "Join our community where faith grows, love thrives, and lives are transformed. Sunday services at 12:30 PM in Wendell, NC.",
  image: "/images/bgp-og-image.jpg",
};
```

### Meta Tags Included:
- Title tag
